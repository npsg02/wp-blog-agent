See [docs/features/HEALTH_CHECK_FEATURE.md](docs/features/HEALTH_CHECK_FEATURE.md) for detailed documentation.

## How It Works

1. **Task Enqueueing**: When triggered (manually or scheduled), a task is added to the queue
2. **Queue Processing**: WordPress cron processes the queue asynchronously
3. **Topic Selection**: The plugin selects a topic from your configured list (or uses specified topic)
4. **Prompt Building**: Creates an optimized prompt with the topic, keywords, and hashtags
5. **AI Generation**: Sends the prompt to your selected AI provider (OpenAI, Gemini, or Ollama)
6. **Content Processing**: Parses the response to extract title and content
7. **Post Creation**: Creates a WordPress post with the generated content
8. **Publishing**: Publishes the post or saves as draft based on your settings
9. **Queue Update**: Marks task as completed or failed (with retry logic)

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.0 or higher
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- Active internet connection
- Valid API key for OpenAI or Google Gemini

## Database Tables

The plugin creates the following custom tables:

- `wp_blog_agent_topics`: Stores topics, keywords, and hashtags
- `wp_blog_agent_queue`: Stores generation task queue with status tracking
- `wp_blog_agent_series`: Stores post series information (name, description)
- `wp_blog_agent_series_posts`: Stores relationships between series and posts

## File Storage

The plugin creates log files in:

- `wp-content/uploads/wp-blog-agent-logs/`: Activity logs (protected with .htaccess)

## Cron Jobs

The plugin uses WordPress Cron to schedule automated generation:

- Hook: `wp_blog_agent_generate_post` - Adds tasks to queue based on schedule
- Hook: `wp_blog_agent_process_queue` - Processes queued tasks asynchronously
- Frequencies: hourly, twicedaily, daily, weekly

## Security

- API keys are stored securely in WordPress options
- All user inputs are sanitized and validated
- Nonce verification for all form submissions
- Capability checks for admin actions
- Log files protected from direct access
- Prepared statements for database queries
- Output escaping to prevent XSS

## Troubleshooting

### Health Check First

**Always start with the Health Check page** (`Blog Agent → Health Check`) when troubleshooting:
- Identifies issues across all components
- Provides actionable recommendations
- Tests API connectivity with response times
- Validates database integrity
- Monitors queue health and statistics

### Posts Not Being Generated

1. Run Health Check to identify issues
2. Check that you have entered a valid API key
3. Verify that scheduling is enabled
4. Ensure you have at least one active topic
5. Check WordPress error logs for any issues

### API Errors

- **OpenAI**: Verify your API key has sufficient credits
- **Gemini**: Ensure your API key is valid and has proper permissions
- Check your internet connection
- Use Health Check to test API connectivity

### Scheduling Issues

- Verify that WordPress Cron is working on your server
- Some hosting providers disable WP-Cron; you may need to set up a system cron job
- Check the Logs page for scheduling errors
- Use Health Check to verify cron job status

### Check Logs

- Go to **Blog Agent** → **Logs**
- Look for ERROR or WARNING entries
- Check timestamps to see when issues occurred
- Use logs to debug API or generation issues

### Development Tools

#### Version Bump Script

The `bump-version.sh` script automates the version bump process:

```bash
./bump-version.sh 1.0.2
```

This script will:
1. Update the version in `wp-blog-agent.php` (both header comment and constant)
2. Create a new version section in `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Provide instructions for creating git tags

**Usage:**
```bash
# Bump to a new version
./bump-version.sh <new_version>

# Example: bump to version 1.0.3
./bump-version.sh 1.0.3
```

After running the script:
1. Review the changes with `git diff`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with actual changes for the version
3. Commit the changes
4. Create and push a git tag

See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete deployment instructions including CI/CD workflows.

### CI/CD Workflows

The plugin includes GitHub Actions workflows for automated deployment:

- **Plugin Check** (`.github/workflows/plugin-check.yml`): Validates PHP syntax and runs WordPress Plugin Checker on every push/PR
- **Deploy to WordPress.org** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`): Automatically deploys tagged releases to WordPress.org
- **Create Release** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): Creates GitHub releases with downloadable ZIP files

To deploy a new version:
```bash
./bump-version.sh 1.0.3
git add .
git commit -m "Bump version to 1.0.3"
git tag -a v1.0.3 -m "Version 1.0.3"
git push origin main
git push origin v1.0.3
```

The CI/CD workflows will automatically:
1. Run plugin checks
2. Create a GitHub release with ZIP file
3. Deploy to WordPress.org (requires SVN credentials in repository secrets)
