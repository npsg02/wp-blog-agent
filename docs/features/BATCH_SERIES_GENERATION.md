# Batch Series Post Generation Feature

## Overview

The Batch Series Post Generation feature allows users to generate multiple blog posts simultaneously from AI suggestions. This enhancement to the Series feature enables efficient content creation by:

- Selecting multiple topics at once from AI suggestions
- Generating posts asynchronously in the background
- Allowing users to continue working while posts are being created
- Automatically adding all generated posts to the series

## Problem Statement

**Original Issue (Vietnamese):**
> Khi AI gợi ý trả về 1 danh sách các chủ đề bài viết. Các chủ đề này có thể chọn nhiều đề tạo bài viết tự động cùng 1 lúc. Tất cả phát hoạt động theo bất đồng bộ đề user không cần chờ ở giao diện

**Translation:**
When AI suggestions return a list of topic posts, users should be able to select multiple topics to generate posts automatically at the same time. All operations should work asynchronously so the user doesn't need to wait at the interface.

## User Experience

### Before (Single Selection)
1. Click "Get AI Suggestions" on a series
2. AI returns 5 topic suggestions
3. Select ONE topic using radio button
4. Click "Generate Selected Topic"
5. Wait for post to generate (synchronous, blocks UI)
6. Post is created and added to series
7. Repeat steps 1-6 for each topic

**Issues:**
- Time-consuming for multiple posts
- User must wait for each post to complete
- Cannot generate multiple posts in parallel

### After (Batch Selection)
1. Click "Get AI Suggestions" on a series
2. AI returns 5 topic suggestions
3. **Select MULTIPLE topics using checkboxes**
4. Click "Generate Selected Topics"
5. All topics are added to queue immediately
6. User can continue working (asynchronous)
7. Posts generate in background
8. All posts automatically added to series when complete

**Benefits:**
- Generate multiple posts simultaneously
- No waiting at the interface
- Efficient batch content creation
- Continue working while posts generate

## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes

Added two new columns to the queue table:

```sql
-- Note: In actual implementation, WordPress prefix is used dynamically
-- Example shown with wp_ prefix for clarity
ALTER TABLE {$wpdb->prefix}blog_agent_queue 
ADD COLUMN topic_text varchar(500) DEFAULT NULL,
ADD COLUMN series_id mediumint(9) DEFAULT NULL;
```

**Fields:**
- `topic_text`: Stores the complete topic text/content for series generation (when topic_id is NULL)
- `series_id`: Links the queue task to a specific series

### Queue System Enhancement

#### Modified `WP_Blog_Agent_Queue::enqueue()`

```php
public static function enqueue($topic_id = null, $trigger = 'manual', $metadata = array())
```

**Parameters:**
- `$topic_id`: (int|null) Topic ID from topics table, or NULL for series generation
- `$trigger`: (string) Source of generation (manual, series, scheduled)
- `$metadata`: (array) Additional data including:
  - `topic_text`: (string) Topic title for series generation
  - `series_id`: (int) Series ID to link the post

#### Updated `WP_Blog_Agent_Queue::process_queue()`

The queue processor now detects series generation tasks:

```php
if (!empty($task->topic_text) && !empty($task->series_id)) {
    // Series generation - use topic_text and series_id
    $result = self::generate_series_post($task);
} else {
    // Regular topic-based generation
    $generator = new WP_Blog_Agent_Generator();
    $result = $generator->generate_post($task->topic_id);
}
```

#### New Method: `generate_series_post()`

Handles post generation for series tasks:
- Uses topic_text instead of fetching from topics table
- Generates content using AI provider
- Creates WordPress post
- Adds metadata and links to series
- Respects auto-publish, auto-image, and auto-SEO settings

### Admin Handler Changes

#### Modified `handle_generate_from_suggestion()`

Now accepts multiple topics:

```php
$topics = isset($_POST['topics']) ? $_POST['topics'] : array();

foreach ($topics as $topic) {
    $queue_id = WP_Blog_Agent_Queue::enqueue(
        null, // topic_id is null for series generation
        'series',
        array(
            'topic_text' => $topic,
            'series_id' => $series_id
        )
    );
}
```

**Backward Compatibility:** Still supports single topic via `$_POST['topic']` for existing implementations.

### UI Changes

#### Series Page (admin/series-page.php)

**Radio Buttons → Checkboxes:**
```javascript
// Before
html += '<input type="radio" name="topic" value="' + suggestion + '" required>';

// After
html += '<input type="checkbox" name="topics[]" value="' + suggestion + '">';
```

**Button Text Update:**
- Before: "Generate Selected Topic" (singular)
- After: "Generate Selected Topics" (plural)

**Form Validation:**
```javascript
$('#suggestions-list form').on('submit', function(e) {
    var checkedCount = $(this).find('input[type="checkbox"]:checked').length;
    if (checkedCount === 0) {
        e.preventDefault();
        alert('Please select at least one topic to generate.');
        return false;
    }
});
```

**Help Text Added:**
```
"Select one or more topics to generate posts simultaneously."
```

#### Queue Page (admin/queue-page.php)

Enhanced display to show series tasks:

```php
if (!empty($item->topic_text)) {
    echo esc_html($item->topic_text);
    if (!empty($item->series_id)) {
        echo ' (Series #' . esc_html($item->series_id) . ')';
    }
}
```

### Generator Class Updates

Made helper methods public for reuse in queue processing:

```php
public function parse_content($content)      // Was private
public function generate_excerpt($content)   // Was private
public function process_image_placeholders($content, $topic)  // Was private
```

## Database Migration

### Automatic Upgrade

Added version check in `wp-blog-agent.php`:

```php
function wp_blog_agent_check_upgrade() {
    $current_version = get_option('wp_blog_agent_db_version', '0');
    $plugin_version = WP_BLOG_AGENT_VERSION;
    
    if (version_compare($current_version, $plugin_version, '<')) {
        WP_Blog_Agent_Activator::activate();
        update_option('wp_blog_agent_db_version', $plugin_version);
    }
}
add_action('admin_init', 'wp_blog_agent_check_upgrade');
```

**Process:**
1. On admin page load, check database version
2. If version is older than plugin version, run activator
3. Activator uses `dbDelta()` which safely adds new columns
4. Update version number in database
5. Log the upgrade

### For Existing Installations

The upgrade is **automatic** and **safe**:
- Uses WordPress `dbDelta()` function
- Only adds new columns if they don't exist
- Doesn't affect existing data
- No manual SQL needed
- Works on plugin update

## Features Preserved

All existing features continue to work:

- ✅ Auto-publish setting respected
- ✅ Auto-image generation works
- ✅ Auto-SEO generation works
- ✅ Inline image placeholders processed
- ✅ Posts appear in "Generated Posts" page
- ✅ Logging system tracks all operations
- ✅ Works with OpenAI, Gemini, and Ollama
- ✅ Queue retry logic (up to 3 attempts)
- ✅ Regular topic-based generation unchanged

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Generate 3 Posts

1. Navigate to **Blog Agent** → **Series**
2. Open your "WordPress Tutorials" series
3. Click "Get AI Suggestions"
4. AI suggests 5 topics:
   - Understanding WordPress Hooks
   - Custom Post Types Explained
   - WordPress REST API Basics
   - Building Custom Gutenberg Blocks
   - WordPress Security Best Practices
5. Check boxes for first 3 topics
6. Click "Generate Selected Topics"
7. Success message: "3 topics have been added to the generation queue!"
8. Navigate to **Blog Agent** → **Queue** to monitor
9. See 3 pending tasks with status "Pending"
10. Tasks process automatically every 10 seconds
11. Once completed, all 3 posts are in your series

### Example 2: Generate All Suggestions

1. Get AI suggestions for your series
2. Use "Select All" browser feature (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A after clicking first checkbox)
3. All 5 checkboxes selected
4. Click "Generate Selected Topics"
5. All 5 posts queued for generation
6. 5 posts created asynchronously

## Performance Considerations

### Queue Processing

- **Interval:** Tasks process every 10 seconds
- **Concurrency:** One task at a time (sequential)
- **Retry Logic:** Up to 3 attempts on failure
- **Wait Between Tasks:** 10 seconds

### For 5 Posts

Assuming each post takes 30 seconds to generate:
- **Before:** 150 seconds (30 × 5) synchronous
- **After:** 150 seconds total, but user can work immediately
- **User Perceived Wait:** 0 seconds (async)

### Optimization Tips

1. Monitor queue page during generation
2. Don't queue too many tasks at once (recommend max 10)
3. Ensure WordPress cron is working properly
4. Check logs if tasks fail repeatedly

## Error Handling

### Queue Failures

If a task fails:
1. Error logged with details
2. Task status set to "failed" or "pending" (for retry)
3. Attempts counter incremented
4. Retry after 5 minutes if attempts < 3
5. User can view error in queue page

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Posts not generating
- **Check:** Queue page for task status
- **Fix:** View error message in queue item

**Issue:** Tasks stuck in "processing"
- **Check:** WordPress cron is running
- **Fix:** Ensure WP-Cron is enabled on server

**Issue:** All tasks failing
- **Check:** API key is valid
- **Check:** Logs page for detailed errors

1. **Old code using radio button:** Still works
2. **Existing queue tasks:** Process normally
3. **Topic-based generation:** Unchanged
4. **Manual generation:** Unchanged
5. **Database schema:** Safely upgraded

### Forward Compatibility

The implementation is extensible:

1. Additional metadata can be added to queue
2. Other features can use topic_text + custom fields
3. Queue system can handle different task types
4. UI pattern can be reused elsewhere

## Security Considerations

### Nonce Verification

All forms protected:
```php
check_admin_referer('wp_blog_agent_generate_from_suggestion');
```

### Input Sanitization

All inputs sanitized:
```php
$topics = array_map('sanitize_text_field', $topics);
```

### Capability Checks

Admin only:
```php
if (!current_user_can('manage_options')) {
    wp_die(__('You do not have sufficient permissions'));
}
```

### SQL Injection Prevention

Using prepared statements:
```php
$wpdb->insert($table_name, $data, $format);
```

## Logging

All operations logged:

```
INFO: Enqueueing series posts for generation (series_id: 5, topics_count: 3)
INFO: Series post enqueued (queue_id: 101, topic: "WordPress Hooks", series_id: 5)
INFO: Processing task (queue_id: 101, topic_text: "WordPress Hooks", series_id: 5)
INFO: Generating post from series suggestion (series_id: 5, topic: "WordPress Hooks")
SUCCESS: Series post created successfully (post_id: 456, series_id: 5)
```

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:

1. **Bulk Actions:** Select all / Deselect all buttons
2. **Priority Queue:** High priority for certain topics
3. **Parallel Processing:** Multiple concurrent generations
4. **Progress Bar:** Real-time generation progress
5. **Email Notifications:** Notify when batch completes
6. **Scheduled Batches:** Generate batches at specific times
7. **Draft Review:** Batch review before publishing
8. **AI Batch Optimization:** Better prompts for batch generation

## Conclusion
